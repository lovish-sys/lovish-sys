# 💫 About Me:
I’m currently working on building a strong foundation in C++ by developing small to medium projects focused on data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. Most of my work revolves around implementing core concepts like stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hashing, and algorithmic problem solving.<br><br>I’m actively learning modern C++, improving my use of the STL, and trying to write cleaner, more efficient code. I’m open to collaborating on beginner-to-intermediate C++ projects that are learning-oriented and logic-heavy, especially those that strengthen problem-solving and core CS fundamentals.<br><br>I’m looking for guidance on writing better C++ code, understanding real-world programming practices beyond university coursework, and improving my overall approach to solving problems. You can ask me about C++ basics, OOP concepts, and data structures as I enjoy breaking problems down and understanding how things work internally rather than relying on black-box solutions.
